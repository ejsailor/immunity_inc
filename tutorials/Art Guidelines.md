# Art Guidelines

The animations and drawings featured in the game were drawn in Krita, a free and full-featured desktop painting software. You can [download Krita by following this link.](https://krita.org/en/)

Krita's animation workspace receives frequent updates, so it's best to refer to [the official documentation](https://docs.krita.org/en/user_manual/animation.html) to get the most up to date tutorial on how to create animations in Krita.

The easiest way to import animations into Construct is from a spritesheet, but as of writing (4/28/21) Krita lacks native support for exporting animations as spritesheets. You will have to install [Falano's kritaSpritesheetManager](https://github.com/Falano/kritaSpritesheetManager) if you are interested in saving animations as spritesheets.

All art was drawn using a Wacom Intuos tablet. That said, any tablet with >=4,096 levels pressure sensitivity will get equivalent results. This includes touchscreen tablets such as the iPad Pro (paired with the Apple Pencil) and Surface Pro (paired with the Surface Pen).
