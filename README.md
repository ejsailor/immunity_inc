Immunity Incorporated (Immunity Inc) is a free game detailing the functions and mechanisms of the immune system. The goal of this project is to increase awareness and understanding of the immune system so that individuals can make better-informed decisions regarding their health, especially in relation to vaccine uptake. Three levels are envisioned for this project, though only one level has been completed.

Each level consists of background story (what the infection is), a map that includes questions and battles, and an outro. The questions should pertain to the branch of the immune system that is featured in the level. The battles get progressively more difficult throughout the map.

Level 1: Innate immune system
  The first level includes introduction to the game and the immune system directed by the Helper T cell. The host is challenged by a weak bacterium that is neutralized by the innate immune response. This level features macrophage, dendritic cell, and neutrophil. These cells neutralize a random number of pathogens each round, and cause a random amount of host damage due to inflammation. In the future, the opportunity to activate macrophages to be either anti- or pro-inflammatory should be added, as well as the opportunity for the neutrophil to undergo NETosis.
  
Level 2: Memory immune system
  This level will take the player through an encounter with a pathogen the host has seen before: Measles. The host has seen this pathogen through a vaccine, giving the opportunity to provide vaccine awareness. This level should feature Memory B Cells, NK cells, and Cytotoxic Memory T cells. In this level, players should try to neutralize/kill measles-infected cells through opsonization with antibodies and killing with cytotoxic memory T cells and NK cells. NK cells will rely on the opsonization by antibodies to kill, and Cytotoxic Memory T cells can kill virus-infected cells by recognizing the viral antigens displayed on their surface. 
  
Level 3: Adaptive immune system
  This level will combine the other two levels to feature the robust activity of the immune system. In this level, the host will be infected with influenza, but will not have received the influenza vaccine. This again provides opportunity to increase vaccine awareness. This level will include a licensed Antigen-Presenting Cell - Dendritic Cell, a CD4 T-cell, CD8 T-Cell, and B cell. The APC will have to engage with the pathogen, then with the CD4 T cell in order for the CD4 T cell to be used in battle. This should take several turns to reflect the time it takes for the adaptive immune system to be activated. The CD4 T cell will then be able to activate the CD8 T cell to make it more efficient at killing virus-infected cells. B cells are able to opsonize the virus-infected cells to improve killing, but must be activated by CD4 T cells following a prior encounter with the antigen before it can undergo clonal expansion or antibody production. 
  
Additional add ons
  Additional add ons would include upgrading the map so that it more reflects a Level-based game, including pharmacies where players can use points from answering questions to purchase medications that alter/improve the immune response, and making the game able to be saved and returned to. 
  
This project has been supported by the Latham Science Engagement Initiative at the University of Iowa.
